# Dissertation_Code

Hello, my name is timothy elvira. This repo is for my dissertation code. If you would like further information on how to use these scripts, feel free to email me at ELVIRAT@my.erau.edu.

The ordering is Transfroms, then object detection, then visualization.

Transforms takes in a "seed" dataset which then creates many separate folders with the transforms applied to each folder, based on a .txt file that include the requirement specifications.
Word of warning, these datasets are heavily coupled to my file directory. With that being said, hopefully the concept is conveyed.

Object Detection folder contains the YOLO script with the YOLO model going through all the files generated by the 1D and 2D Transform scripts, found in the transforms folder.

Requirements folder is the code that helped boiler plate the requirements found in the dissertation_results repository.

Supplementary are scripts which I used to batch file run the 1D and 2D transforms for a few object classes within the YOLO model.


The concept can be shown in the images, taken from my dissertation.

For the generated datasets, email me. These are hefty datasets, around 144 gigs and might need to be shared through zenodo or AWS.

The YOLOv8 Object detection phase where it uses image paths and loads the images to detect the mean weighted confidence and the mAP.

The full process of the visualization generation stage, showing the output of 2-transform or 1-transform for gaussian blurring.
